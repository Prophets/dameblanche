The code in this project is to be used as the base for (not*) every project.
It does not mean that this code cannot be altered.

The goal is to have discussions about every aspect, until we reach a solution
that works for everybody. At that point, the code will be altered and we can
move on...

The purpose of this project is that we reach a singular workflow for our FE
projects. Its benefits should be that it is easier to read eachothers code and
a more standard workflow. in the long run this should buy us a lot of time and
kill frustrations :)

Cheers!

*offcourse not every project is a candidate for this setup, but we should strive
to fit as much as possible in this workflow
