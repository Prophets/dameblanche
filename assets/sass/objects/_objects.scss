/// In here object selectors can be styled.
/// For me, an object is an element that is used context-independent.(ex.: an icon, a button, ...)
/// The the difference with a component, is that an component is context-dependent (ex.: a product, a carousel, a navigation-bar, a footer, a payment,...)
/// As a guide, i state the following rule: 'a component can have objects and components as children,
/// whereas an object can have no objects or components as children'
