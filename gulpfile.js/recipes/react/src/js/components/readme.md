In short: Components only contains components for presentational purposes

* Are concerned with how things look.
* May contain both presentational and container components** inside, and usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own.
* Often allow containment via this.props.children.
* Have no dependencies on the rest of the app, such as stores or actions
* Don’t specify how the data is loaded or mutated.
* Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.
* Rarely have their own state (when they do, it’s UI state rather than data).
* Are written as functional components unless they need state, lifecycle hooks, or performance optimizations.
